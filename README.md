# JavaForMe
## Download JDK

## Environment Variables
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<version>

For example, if you have installed JDK 16, you would set JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-16.

PATH= %JAVA_HOME%\bin

Once you have set the JAVA_HOME environment variable, you should also add the bin directory of the JDK to your system's PATH environment variable. This allows you to run Java command-line tools such as java, javac, and jar from anywhere in the command line.
